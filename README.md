# Shortest-Route-with-Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm


What is this for ?
============
In computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

İmportant Libraries:
-Folium 
-PyQt5
-geopy

Aim
============
Our purpose is finding coordinates using the floyd-warshall algorithm over direct or determined points of the shortest distance between two certain points



Installation
============
.exe file will be added soon...
